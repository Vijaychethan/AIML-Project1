        "    With age, the disease burden increases. Interestingly, the same pathways that modulate longevity affect the development of multiple, age-related pathologies. Ageing as a disease risk factor can be thought of as the accrued effect of a finite number of evolutionarily conserved pathways.\n",

        " while the frequency of CVD tends to be lower in women before menopause than in men, the frequency dramatically increases after menopause, when it accounts for approximately one out of every three deaths in women.\n",
        "In addition, many of the \"classic\" signs and symptoms of CVD are based on medical research largely performed in men. For example, many think of chest pain as a typical symptom of a heart attack. But while both men and women can experience chest pain, women are more likely to experience atypical symptoms such as nausea or vomiting, shortness of breath, dizziness, or no symptoms at all. What’s more, 64% of women who die suddenly of coronary heart disease had no previous symptoms.\n",

        "*   Atypical angina:  person is said to suffer from atypical chest pain, which unlike typical chest pain, doesn’t occur in the sternum and may radiate to other parts of the body.\n",
        "*   non-anginal pain:A chest pain is very likely nonanginal if its duration is over 30 minutes or less than 5 seconds, it increases with inspiration, can be brought on with one movement of the trunk or arm, can be brought on by local fingers pressure, or bending forward, or it can be relieved immediately on lying down. \n",
        "*   asymptomatic : Asymptomatic heart attacks medically known as silent myocardial infarction (SMI) annually accounts for around 45-50% of morbidities due to cardiac ailments and even premature deaths in India. The incidences among middle aged people experiencing SMI is twice likely to develop in males than females. The symptoms of SMI being very mild in comparison to an actual heart attack; it is described as a silent killer. Because sometimes there is no cardiac arrest symptoms. \n",

In other words, it doesn't rise as you get stronger or faster, and it doesn't mean that someone with a higher MHR is in better shape than you.However, knowing your max HR can help you track your fitness progress and determine your target heart rate. That can give you a more exact method of determining your exercise intensity \n",
